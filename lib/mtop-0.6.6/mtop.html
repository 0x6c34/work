<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>Shows the MySQL commands consuming the greatest time.  By default, only non-sleeping 
threads are shown, the <STRONG>--idle</STRONG> option shows idle threads.  While running several 
keys will affect the operation of <STRONG>mtop</STRONG>.  Hitting <STRONG>h</STRONG> or <STRONG>?</STRONG> will show the 
available options.</P>
<P>Normally, run as a console program this will allow you to see errant or badly 
optimized queries as they will stay on the screen for a while.  However, if you
are hunting for short lived queries, running in the <STRONG>manualrefresh</STRONG> mode with a 
short refresh time will allow you to catch short lived queries as well.</P>
<P>The following keys are active while <STRONG>mtop</STRONG> is running:</P>
<PRE>
    q - quit
    ? - help</PRE>
<PRE>
    Filtering/display</PRE>
<PRE>
    s - change the number of seconds to delay between updates
    m - toggle manual refresh mode on/off
    d - filter display with regular expression (user/host/db/command/state/info)
    F - fold/unfold column names in select statement display
    h - display process for only one host
    u - display process for only one user
    i - toggle all/non-Sleeping process display
    o - reverse the sort order</PRE>
<PRE>
    Control/Detail</PRE>
<PRE>
    k - kill processes; send a kill to a list of ids
    e - explain a process; show query optimizer info
    z - zoom in on a process; show sql statement detail 
    f - flush stats (reset show status variables)
    t - show mysqld stats (show status/mysqladmin ext)
    T - show short/important status
    v - show mysqld variables (show variables/mysqladmin vars)
    r - show replication status for master/slaves</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Main Screen</STRONG></P>
<P>The main query screen shows the following information as well as the currently
active queries (explanations are from the MySQL online manual and 
references refer to the section in the manual where the explanation came from):</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_n_Threads%3A_running%2C_cached">n Threads: running, cached</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The <STRONG>n</STRONG> Threads represents how many threads the mysqld has allocated.  One
thread is allocated for each user connection.  Additional threads are allocated
for replication.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Queries%2Fslow%3A_Total_queries_%2F_Total_SLOW_QUE">Queries/slow: Total queries / Total SLOW QUERIES</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The first number is the total number of queries sent to the server
since the last 'flush status' or since server start.  The second
number is the number of queries that have taken more than 
long_query_time. See section 4.9.5 The Slow Query Log.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Cache_Hit%3A_Cache_hit_ratio">Cache Hit: Cache hit ratio</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This is the percentage of times a key read is handled from the 
key buffer cache.  See section 4.5.7.4 <STRONG>SHOW VARIABLES</STRONG> of 
the MySQL manual for more information.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Opened_tables%3A_tables_opened">Opened tables: tables opened</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
MySQL has a cache for open tables.  If 'opened tables' is high, your cache
may be too small.  Look at the MySQL manual section: <STRONG>5.4.7 How MySQL Opens 
and Closes Tables</STRONG> for further information.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_RRN%3A_Handler_read_rnd_next">RRN: Handler_read_rnd_next</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Number of requests to read the next row in the datafile. This will be 
high if you are doing a lot of table scans. Generally this suggests 
that your tables are not properly indexed or that your queries are 
not written to take advantage of the indexes you have. (4.5.7.3)
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_TLW%3A_Table_locks_waited">TLW: Table_locks_waited</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Number of times a table lock could not be acquired immediately and a 
wait was needed. If this is high, and you have performance problems, 
you should first optimise your queries, and then either split your 
<CODE>table(s)</CODE> or use replication. Available after 3.23.33.  (4.5.7.3)
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_SFJ%3A_Select_full_join">SFJ: Select_full_join</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Number of joins without keys (If this is not 0, you should carefully 
check the indexes of your tables). (4.5.7.3)
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_SMP%3A_Sort_merge_passes">SMP: Sort_merge_passes</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Number of merges passes the sort algoritm have had to do. If this value 
is large you should consider increasing sort_buffer. (4.5.7.3)
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_QPS%3A_Questions_per_second">QPS: Questions per second</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The total number of sql commands handled by the MySQL server since startup
or the last <STRONG>flush status</STRONG> command.
<P></P></DL>
<P><STRONG>Statistics/Variables</STRONG></P>
<P>When viewing the <EM>stats</EM> screen (<STRONG>t</STRONG>), the screen will refresh until a key is 
pressed at which point you will return to the main screen.  The bottom of the 
<EM>stats</EM> screen is denoted with a line containing <STRONG>---</STRONG>.  If you do not see
that line, resize your screen until you do.</P>
<P>The statistics screen has the following format:</P>
<PRE>
    Stat:      total [avg per sec / instant per sec ]</PRE>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE>
    Questions:     720,672 [30/12]</PRE>
<P>The <EM>short/important</EM> status screen is a list of recommendations from the
MySQL manual.</P>
<P>The first number is the total since startup or the last 'flush status'. 
The second number is the number per second since startup or flush.  The
last is the number per second since the last screen refresh.</P>
<P>The <EM>variables</EM> screen only shows the information once and returns to the main 
screen as the variables do not change after server startup.</P>
<P><STRONG>Replication</STRONG></P>
<P>The replication monitor screen looks for a master or slave server running on the currently
monitored mysqld.  If a master server is found, it then tries to connect to each slave
connected to the master.  Replication is shown for all masters and slaves found.
Offsets from the master for each of the slaves is shown.  Note: the offset may be less
than zero because the slave position is checked after the master position.  The offset
shown is the number of queries in the binlog that the slave has to process before
being caught up with the master.</P>

<DD>
Filter the display based on the <STRONG>regex_pattern</STRONG> provided.  The <STRONG>regex_pattern</STRONG> is a perl
regular expression.  The regular expression match is done with case insensitivity.
<P>For example, to only show <STRONG>select</STRONG> statements on the <STRONG>user</STRONG> table, use the following:</P>
<PRE>
    --filter-info='select from user'</PRE>
<P>or, to be more forgiving for mutil-table joins and extra spaces, use:</P>
<PRE>
    --filter-info='select\s+from\s+.*\buser\b.*where'</PRE>
<P>These same regular expression filters can be used with the interactive <STRONG>d</STRONG> command.
Be careful to escape any special shell characters in the regex.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Dm%2C_%2D%2Dmanualrefresh">-m, --manualrefresh</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
In this mode, the screen only refreshes when the user hits a key on the
keyboard.  The screen will refresh automatically until a query is seen and then wait for 
further input.  An uppercase M will appear in the top right hand corner of the screen to 
indicate that you are in this mode.
<P></P></DL>
<P>All options can be stored in initialization files.  Command line options override
options stored in the initialization file(s).  The following files are checked for
arguments: current direcotry .mtoprc, home directory .mtoprc, /usr/local/etc/mtoprc, 
/etc/mtoprc.  Options in the former files override options in the later files.</P>
<P>The format of the initialization file is one option per line.  Options are specified just
as they would be on the command line.  They can be abbreviated and use the one or two hyphen
syntax.  Comments and blank lines are ignored.  The following is an exmple .mtoprc file 
which sets a user filter to user1 and sets the refresh rate to one second:</P>
<PRE>
    #  Only look at 'user1'
    -fu user1
    --seconds=1   # refresh every one seconds</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="setup">SETUP</A></H1>
<P>The most convenient way to setup your system to use <STRONG>mtop</STRONG> is to create a database user
called <STRONG>mysqltop</STRONG> which has no password.  For security purposes, this user should have 
all privileges set to <STRONG>N</STRONG> except <STRONG>Process_priv</STRONG> which must be set to <STRONG>Y</STRONG>.</P>
<P>To grant these privileges, execute the following from the MySQL command prompt</P>
<P>For mysql 4.0.2 and greater:</P>
<PRE>
    mysql&gt; grant super, reload, process on *.* to mysqltop;
    mysql&gt; grant super, reload, process on *.* to mysqltop@localhost;
    mysql&gt; flush privileges;</PRE>
<P>For mysql 3.x and 4.0.1:</P>
<PRE>
    mysql&gt; grant reload, process on *.* to mysqltop;
    mysql&gt; grant reload, process on *.* to mysqltop@localhost;
    mysql&gt; flush privileges;</PRE>
<P>Notes:</P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>
GRANT only works in MySQL 3.22.11 or later, for earlier versions add the user
manually and fix the permissions as noted above.
<P></P>
<DT><DD>
The GRANT to mysqltop and mysqltop@localhost may be modified depending upon which 
hosts you want to grant access from.  In general, you probably want to limit it to 
the hosts in your domain.
<P></P>
<DT><DD>
The <STRONG>reload</STRONG> privilege is not required for <STRONG>mtop</STRONG> to do basic monitoring.  It is 
only needed if you wish to issue <STRONG>flush</STRONG> commands from <STRONG>mtop</STRONG>.  The <STRONG>super</STRONG>
privilege is needed if you wish to kill queries in mysql 4.0.2 versions and
above.  In 3.x, the <STRONG>process</STRONG> privilege allows a user to terminate a query.
<P></P></DL>
<P>Initially, <STRONG>mtop</STRONG> does not connect to a specific database.  Most commands this 
program issues are non-database specific (SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST, SHOW VARIABLES, 
KILL id).  However, when database-specific commands are needed, <STRONG>mtop</STRONG> will try to 
connect to the the required database and prompt for a username/password if the default one fails.</P>
<P>To install <STRONG>mtop</STRONG>, run the following shell commands:</P>
<PRE>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install</PRE>
<P>The default {install_prefix} is /usr/local which means that <STRONG>mtop</STRONG> is installed 
in /usr/local/bin/.  To change this, run:</P>
<PRE>
    perl Makefile.PL --prefix={install_prefix}
</PRE>
<PRE>

or modify the PREFIX line in Makefile.PL.</PRE>
<P>Requires the following perl modules:</P>

<P>The cache hit ratio may look very low if your server receives more than 
4 billion key_read_requests.  This is due to a roll-over condition.  If that
number exceeds 4 billion and change, it rolls over to 1.  The cache 
hit ratio is calculated as: 100 - (key_reads/key_read_requests) * 100.</P>
<P>If you are really trying to focus on the cache hit ratio, flush the status
variables with the <STRONG>mtop</STRONG> <STRONG>f</STRONG> command to reset both the key_reads and
key_read_requests.</P>
<P>Win2K telnet.exe - If you are using the Windows 2000 telnet program, it defaults
to ansi mode which doesn't work well with curses (in my testing on Solaris 8).  
To work around this, set the terminal type to vt100.  To do this, issue the
following command from the telnet prompt before connecting to a host:</P>
<PRE>
    set term vt100</PRE>
<P>Alternatively, you can manually set your TERM environment variable to vt100
after you are logged in.</P>
